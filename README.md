# This is a Tableau Project analysing 🧐 Customer Churn ⛔ from an example telecom company called Databel.
# Below you will explore an step by step BI analysis focused on what are the main reasons of customer churn and how to mitigate it.


## Throughout this analysis we want to answer questions like this:

### Why customers are churning at the rate they are?
### How we can improve our churn rates?
### what is the cause of most customer churn?


## I have followed the following steps to carry out my analysis:

### ✅  Exploratory analysis of the dataset and collection of the main KPIs.
